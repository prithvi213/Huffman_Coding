Long renowned for his superb defense and ability to handle a staff, Maldonado became the Astros’ top catcher across the last half-decade. Despite a .623 OPS in an Astros uniform -- that number dropped to .593 the last three seasons -- Maldonado was slotted in as Houston’s primary catcher due to his defense and success working with Astros pitchers. 2023 breakout rookie Yainer Diaz and veteran catcher Victor Caratini -- whom the Astros signed to a multi-year contract this offseason -- will handle catching duties for Houston in 2024.

Maldonado also worked with manager Pedro Grifol in Kansas City during the 2019 campaign, when Grifol was part of the Royals' coaching staff. He played with Korey Lee in Houston, with Lee being acquired at the '23 Trade Deadline in exchange for reliever Kendall Graveman as one of the team’s potential catchers of the future.

“I got to be around Martín Maldonado, I got to learn from him,” Lee said this past September. “I got to see how he managed a pitching staff at that end. Learned how he communicated with pitchers and it taught me a lot.

“I’m going to carry that further into my career and make it my way, but he taught me how to be a professional catcher over there in Houston. They knew how to win and I want to bring that over to the White Sox.”

This signing is sensible for the White Sox with a young pitching staff that now has another backstop to pair with Max Stassi, whom the team acquired from the Braves earlier this month, and Lee. With potential turnover coming for a White Sox team headed by new general manager Chris Getz -- who might be tasked with moving frontline starter Dylan Cease -- there’s value in signing a veteran catcher who’s been a part of many winning Astros teams.

Lee, 25, impressed the White Sox with his September work behind the plate, but for his young big league career, Lee is hitting .100 at the plate. Edgar Quero, the team’s 20-year-old switch-hitting catcher ranked No. 81 overall by MLB Pipeline, will benefit from working with Maldonado.

The White Sox had strong interest in Maldonado prior to acquiring Stassi, but that interest clearly continued for a catcher with 202 plate appearances and 65 games worth of playoff experience. Maldonado (8,663 2/3 innings) joins Salvador Perez (10,063 2/3), J.T. Realmuto (8,923 1/3), Yasmani Grandal (8,404 2/3) and Yan Gomes (8,242 2/3) as the only active backstops with more than 8,000 innings caught.

DETROIT -- It's history that not many fans inside Little Caesars Arena were looking forward to experiencing Tuesday night, but the Detroit Pistons couldn't avoid NBA infamy, dropping their 27th straight game with a 118-112 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.

It's the most consecutive losses in a single season in league history. The 76ers have the overall record, losing 28 straight, but that spanned the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons.

Detroit hasn't won a game since its home opener Oct. 28, against Chicago, and now is 2-28 on the season.

Entering Tuesday's game, Pistons coach Monty Williams couldn't avoid the topic of the all-time losing mark -- something he didn't want his name connected to - but it continues to weigh heavy on the franchise.

"I'm sure it was. Again, when you look at records, you think of coaches, but I'm sure the players don't want that attached to the name on the jersey," Williams said. "Was it heavy? It's been heavy for a while. That's just the nature of this kind of losing streak and it's not gonna change because we're grading the level of it, we've got to do what we've got to do to change it."

The Pistons have the second-longest losing streak in NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB history. The Sixers' 28-game losing streak in 2015 spanned multiple seasons.

Cade Cunningham, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2021 draft, finished with a game-high 41 points to go along with 9 rebounds and 5 assists. He had 37 points in the second half alone, but has now lost all 10 career games when scoring 30 or more points -- the longest streak to start a career in NBA history, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.

After the game, Cunningham addressed the team passionately in the locker room about the things they needed to fix while holding themselves accountable for where they are as they try to overcome this rough patch. He told teammates "Don't' jump off the boat" and to "stay together" as losing continues to mount.

"I don't think what I said was positivity, I think it's just being real ... there's nothing positive about this situation right now that we put ourselves in so that's why we have to dig deep and get ourselves out of it," Cunningham said. "You can't get away from it. It weighs on us every day, I mean everywhere. It weighs on us."

The Pistons got off to a fast start in the opening quarter, holding a 14-point, double-digit lead for the first time in a contest since Nov. 12 (against the Bulls), but committed six turnovers in the second quarter and entered halftime trailing 61-54.

Cunningham went off for 18 points in the third quarter as the Pistons went down 71-60 at 8:35 after a driving floater by Cam Johnson, but pulled within three entering the fourth. Fans chanted "Let's go Pistons" during the final frame, trying to rally the home team as Cunningham nailed a trey at 8:10 to put Detroit up 97-92.

But the Nets closed the game on a 26-15 run to etch the 2023-24 Pistons in the history books. As the final seconds ticked off the clock, a host of fans started to chant, "Sell the team! Sell the team!" though Pistons owner Tom Gores was not in the building to hear it.

The chants didn't sit well with some of the players.

"We have the right people in this locker room and most importantly, I just heard the fans talking about sell the team and just in my mind it's like what we talked about, who is with us? Whose really with us?" said second-year guard Jaden Ivey, who ended with 9 points and 4 assists. "The crowd was amazing, I thought, but there's some that [I'm wondering] who is really with us?

"Chanting 'sell the team,' I thought it was a bit much because we're growing and obviously the record and a lot of people expected us to be better in this upcoming point of the season but we're gonna continue to row the boat and we're gonna forget what everybody else says, stay together and play for each other."

C read with dynamic buffer
ChatGPT
To read input with a dynamic buffer in C, you can use the malloc function to allocate memory for the buffer and then use functions like fgets or getline to read input into the dynamically allocated buffer. Here's an example using getline, which dynamically allocates memory for a buffer and reads a line from the standard input:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = NULL;
    size_t bufferSize = 0;
    ssize_t bytesRead;

    printf("Enter a line of text (Ctrl+D to end on Unix/Linux, Ctrl+Z on Windows):\n");

    // Read a line of input into the dynamically allocated buffer
    bytesRead = getline(&buffer, &bufferSize, stdin);

    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        perror("Error reading input");
    } else {
        // Print the input
        printf("You entered: %s", buffer);

        // Process the input as needed

        // Free the dynamically allocated buffer
        free(buffer);
    }

    return 0;
}
In this example:

getline is used to read a line of input. It automatically allocates memory for the buffer as needed.
The function returns the number of bytes read (including the newline character) or -1 on failure.
The free function is used to release the memory allocated for the buffer when you're done using it.
Remember that dynamic memory allocation comes with responsibilities. You should always free the memory when you're done using it to avoid memory leaks. Additionally, you may want to check for errors and handle them appropriately based on your application's requirements.

C read() with dynamic buffer
ChatGPT
If you want to use the read system call to read input into a dynamically allocated buffer in C, you can combine it with malloc for dynamic memory allocation. Here's an example:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    char *buffer = NULL;
    size_t bufferSize = BUFFER_SIZE;  // Initial buffer size
    ssize_t bytesRead;

    buffer = (char *)malloc(bufferSize * sizeof(char));
    if (buffer == NULL) {
        perror("Error allocating memory");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter text (Ctrl+D to end on Unix/Linux, Ctrl+Z on Windows):\n");

    // Use a loop to read data in chunks
    while ((bytesRead = read(STDIN_FILENO, buffer, bufferSize)) > 0) {
        // Process the read data as needed
        // ...

        // Resize the buffer if necessary
        bufferSize += BUFFER_SIZE;
        buffer = (char *)realloc(buffer, bufferSize * sizeof(char));
        if (buffer == NULL) {
            perror("Error reallocating memory");
            free(buffer);
            return 1;
        }
    }

    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        perror("Error reading input");
        free(buffer);
        return 1;
    }

    // Process the final content of the buffer
    // ...

    printf("You entered: %s\n", buffer);

    // Free the dynamically allocated buffer
    free(buffer);

    return 0;
}
In this example:

read is used to read input from the standard input (file descriptor STDIN_FILENO). It reads data in chunks, and the loop continues until there is no more data to read.
The buffer is initially allocated with a fixed size, and realloc is used to dynamically resize the buffer when needed.
The program dynamically allocates memory for the buffer using malloc and later resizes it using realloc.
Error handling is included to check for failures in memory allocation, reallocation, and reading.
Remember to free the dynamically allocated memory using free when you are done using it to prevent memory leaks.

c if else with ?
ChatGPT
In C, the conditional operator ? : is a ternary operator that allows you to express a simple conditional statement in a concise form. It can be used as an alternative to the if-else statement when you need to assign a value based on a condition. The general syntax is:

c
Copy code
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
Here's an example of using the ternary operator:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // Using the ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd
    (number % 2 == 0) ? printf("Even\n") : printf("Odd\n");

    return 0;
}
In this example, (number % 2 == 0) ? printf("Even\n") : printf("Odd\n"); is equivalent to an if-else statement:

c
Copy code
if (number % 2 == 0) {
    printf("Even\n");
} else {
    printf("Odd\n");
}
You can use the ternary operator in more complex expressions as well. However, keep in mind that it's generally recommended to use the if-else statement for more complex logic or when the code might be more readable with a full if-else structure. The ternary operator is often preferred for simple, one-line conditions.

User
Can you perform assignments in those type of if-else expressions?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can perform assignments in the expressions of the ternary conditional operator (? :). Here's an example:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // Using the ternary operator to assign a value based on the condition
    int result = (number % 2 == 0) ? 2 : 3;

    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
In this example, the value of result is assigned based on whether the number is even or odd. If number is even, result is assigned the value 2; otherwise, it's assigned the value 3.

You can perform more complex assignments or expressions within the conditional operator as needed. However, it's important to keep the code clear and readable. If the logic becomes too complex, it might be better to use a traditional if-else statement for better readability.
